                            Cutting is the first step of manufacturing the clothing. With the help of template and cutting tool fabrics are cut out from lays of fabrics in this process. This processing stage contains sectioning, twisting and layering the fabrics.

                            In Dhaka Fareast LTD, we have both manual to automatic cutting capability. For flexible handling and small-batch cutting, we prefer manual cutting. Besides, sensitive fabrics are safer to cut out layers by hand. On the other side, big batch fabrics with high-end notches are prepared in automatic cutting. We use Gerber Garment Technology for high accuracy and cutting of huge fabrics at a time.
